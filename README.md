  - Solvers can view the remaining patterns they can fill up and their scores.
  - They will choose one of colors and one postion they want to leave their results, and they can leave a small message with their name and score.


# Organization of Code üíª
## Overall Structure
<img src="data/code_structure.png" width="100%">

## Directory Structure
This is **Directory Structure** of our application

### Client Directory
<img src="data/client-structure.png" width="100%">

- **Reusable components** are stored in the `component` directory.
- **Global store component** is stored in the `context` directory.
- **Pages of the application** are stored horizontally in the `pages` directory.

### Server Directory
<img src="data/server-structure.png" width="100%">

- **Schema of the model** is stored in the `models` directory.
- **Paths that request data from DB** are stored in the `routes` directory.

## Design Patterns
<!-- If you used patterns, what did you use them for, and how do different parts of your code speak to each other? -->
### Atomic Design Pattern
<img src="data/atomic-design-pattern.png" width="80%">

- Divide the components and pages by `Atomic Design Pattern`.
- Why did we use Atomic Design Pattern?
  - Increase `reusability` of components.
  - Increase `scalability` of pages and components.

### Observer Design Pattern
- Pages communicate with components by `props`.
  
  ```js
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Nav isUser={isUser} quizCode={quizCode} />
    ...
  )
  ```

- Why did we use Observer Design Pattern?
  - Increase `reusability` because components receive data only through props.
  - Components and pages can be managed `independently`.
  - Make pages and components `speak to each other`.

### Provider Design Pattern
- Share data across the tree descendant nodes with Context API
  
  ```js
  function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const [isUser, setIsUser] = useState(false)
  const [quizCode, setQuizCode] = useState(null);
  const [quizNickname, setQuizNickname] = useState(null);
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider
      value={{
        isUser,
        setIsUser,
        quizCode,
        setQuizCode,
        quizNickname,
        setQuizNickname,
        score,
        setScore
      }}
    >
      <CssBaseline />
      <Layout>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Layout>
    </AppContext.Provider>
  )}
  ```
- Why did we use Provider Design Pattern?
  - Every components and pages can `share the same state` of application.
  - Solving `prop drilling` in React.
  - Make pages `speak to each other`.

### Routing Design Pattern
- In server, request from client was divided into routes directory by `path`.
  
  ```js
  app.use('/api/users', require('./routes/users'));
  app.use('/api/quizzes', require('./routes/quizzes'));
  app.use('/api/scores', require('./routes/scores'));
  app.use('/api/messages', require('./routes/messages'));
  ```

- Why did we use Routing Design Pattern?
  - Increase `readability` and `ease of management` by Store code separately.
  - `Easy to debug` by tying them together with the same personality.

## Main Functions
<!-- What are the main functions/classes? -->
### Functions in Client
#### pages/_app.js
- `APP()`
  - Top component of every React components.
  - Wrap all pages with the global layout.
  - Especially, wrap all components with a global state using **Context API**.

#### context/AppContext.js
- `createContext(null)`
  - Creates a **global store** used in the application.

#### components directory
- Components like Nav are rendered differently depending on the **state of the page**.
- State of the page is transferred with **props**.

#### pages directory
- **Render** each page of the application.
- Pages created with [id] directory like scoreBoard provides **dynamic routing** using **queries**.

### Functions in Server
#### index.js
- `app.use('/api/{path}', require('./routes/{path}'))`
  - By using the router, the structure of the server has been **simplified and easily scalable**.
- `mongoose.connect()`
  - Connect Node.js server & MongoDB

#### routes/{path}.js
- `router.post()`
  - Post CRUD-related requests to MongoDB.

#### model/{schema}.model.js
- `mongoose.model("{Name}", {name}Schema)`
  - Specify the structure and conditions of the information to be stored in the DB.

# Main Challenge üî•

## Work in Collaboration

### Challenge
- Lack of **collaborative development experience**.
  - Expressing what we want about codes in words was difficult.
  - Distributing works among team members was not efficient initially.
- Difficulty in **communication** between team members.
  - Lack of uniformity among team members' codes.

### How to Overcome
- Re-divided our tasks
  - Maker flow, Solver flow, Database, and CSS(design).
- Set Development rules
  - In **commit messages**, **division of branch**, and **pull requests**
  - Try to understand others' codes and improve `communication quality`.
- Using collaboration tools
  - Figma, Miro, and Notion for works other than development
  - Fully understood what each member said by `visualizating screen(GUI)` and `diagrams`.

## Libraries & Frameworks

### Challenge
- Lack of libraries and frameworks experience
  - Dealing with `dynamic routing` in Next.js.
  - Understanding concept of `SSR` and `SSG` in Next.js.
  - Understanding and utilizing `Grid` in Material-UI.

### How to Overcome
- Sharing contents that learned newly or applied to the code
  - Share the reference links or videos.
  - Try to understand the `philosophy` and `patterns` of libraries and frameworks.
- Sharing built codes regularly
  - Tried to fully understand features of functions in each frameworks with two weekly team meetings.

## User Interfaces

### Challenge
- Hard to modify code neatly with desired UI.
  - As UI was changed, we needed to modify code structures. 
  - To implement immediate feedback on users' actions without errors for better UX was difficult.

### How to Overcome
- Make `consistent` and `resuable` UI for high utilization.
- Rather than js file, modifying css to make visual variations of components.

# What We Learned üßë‚Äçüíª

## Work in Collaboration
- Define overall `structure` and `flow` in application makes efficient progress
- Importance of `sharing progress`
  - Set Development rules
  - Review team member's code
- Importance of `visualization`
  - Visualize material (flowchart or GUI) so that we can look in the same direction.

## Libraries / Frameworks / Tools
- Libraries and frameworks have their philosophy.
- Have to choose a framework that fits the concept of project.
  - Facilitate high `scalability` and `maintenance`.

### Details
- React
   - Designed to `separate` and `synthesize` components to maximize the reusability.
   - Write code `concisely` using React hooks.
- Next.js
   - Easy to develop separate pages and components.
   - Easy to implement `dynamic routing`.
   - Easy to implement with `SSR` and `SSG` for `SEO`.
   - Provides functions related to `router` and `image`.
- Material UI
   - `Easily implement UI` without writing css one by one.
   - MUI's sx option allows to insert the specific css.
- Mongo DB
   - Can store many different forms of data.
   - MongoDB has a good `scalability` and `flexibility`.
- Vercel & Heroku
   - `Easy to deploy` of client and server

# Issue and Known Bug üêû
- We implement our application with `React Hooks`
  - But, Next.js unsupport some React Hooks.
  - So, we initialize contextAPI's value with query.
  - You can see this information in [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18/server-components#unsupported-nextjs-apis)
