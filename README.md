# Description of the Application üìö

## Flow Chart
This is flow chart of our application.
<img src="data/flowchart.jpg" width="100%">

  - If there is no quiz made before, there is a 'make quiz' button in the personal page.
  - By clicking the button, the maker will make his/her own quiz.
  - After making a quiz, personal unique patterns are generated.
  - If friends solve quizzes, the patterns start to be completed.
  - They can filter the results according to the colors.

- ### MakeQuiz Page
  <img src="data/make_quiz.png" width="80%" height="80%">

  - Solvers can view the remaining patterns they can fill up and their scores.
  - They will choose one of colors and one postion they want to leave their results, and they can leave a small message with their name and score.


# Organization of Code üíª
## Overall Structure
<img src="data/code_structure.png" width="100%">

## Directory Structure
This is **Directory Structure** of our application

### Client Directory
<img src="data/client-structure.png" width="100%">

- **Reusable components** are stored in the `component` directory.
- **Global store component** is stored in the `context` directory.
- **Pages of the application** are stored horizontally in the `pages` directory.

### Server Directory
<img src="data/server-structure.png" width="100%">

- **Schema of the model** is stored in the `models` directory.
- **Paths that request data from DB** are stored in the `routes` directory.

## Design Patterns
<!-- If you used patterns, what did you use them for, and how do different parts of your code speak to each other? -->
### Atomic Design Pattern
<img src="data/atomic-design-pattern.png" width="80%">

- Divide the components and pages by `Atomic Design Pattern`.
- Why did we use Atomic Design Pattern?
  - Increase `reusability` of components.
  - Increase `scalability` of pages and components.

### Observer Design Pattern
- Pages communicate with components by `props`.
  
  ```js
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Nav isUser={isUser} quizCode={quizCode} />
    ...
  )
  ```

- Why did we use Observer Design Pattern?
  - Increase `reusability` because components receive data only through props.
  - Components and pages can be managed `independently`.
  - Make pages and components `speak to each other`.


### Provider Design Pattern
- Share data across the tree descendant nodes with Context API
  
  ```js
  function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const [isUser, setIsUser] = useState(false)
  const [quizCode, setQuizCode] = useState(null);
  const [quizNickname, setQuizNickname] = useState(null);
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider
      value={{
        isUser,
        setIsUser,
        quizCode,
        setQuizCode,
        quizNickname,
        setQuizNickname,
        score,
        setScore
      }}
    >
      <CssBaseline />
      <Layout>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Layout>
    </AppContext.Provider>
  )}
  ```
- Why did we use Provider Design Pattern?
  - Every components and pages can `share the same state` of application.
  - Solving `prop drilling` in React.
  - Make pages `speak to each other`.

### Routing Design Pattern
- In server, request from client was divided into routes directory by `path`.
  
  ```js
  app.use('/api/users', require('./routes/users'));
  app.use('/api/quizzes', require('./routes/quizzes'));
  app.use('/api/scores', require('./routes/scores'));
  app.use('/api/messages', require('./routes/messages'));
  ```

- Why did we use Routing Design Pattern?
  - Increase `readability` and `ease of management` by Store code separately.
  - `Easy to debug` by tying them together with the same personality.

## Main Functions
<!-- What are the main functions/classes? -->
### Functions in Client
#### pages/_app.js
- `APP()`
  - Top component of every React components.
  - Wrap all pages with the global layout.
  - Especially, wrap all components with a global state using **Context API**.

#### context/AppContext.js
- `createContext(null)`
  - Creates a **global store** used in the application.

#### components directory
- Components like Nav are rendered differently depending on the **state of the page**.
- State of the page is transferred with **props**.

#### pages directory
- **Render** each page of the application.
- Pages created with [id] directory like scoreBoard provides **dynamic routing** using **queries**.

### Functions in Server
#### index.js
- `app.use('/api/{path}', require('./routes/{path}'))`
  - By using the router, the structure of the server has been **simplified and easily scalable**.
- `mongoose.connect()`
  - Connect Node.js server & MongoDB

#### routes/{path}.js
- `router.post()`
  - Post CRUD-related requests to MongoDB.

#### model/{schema}.model.js
- `mongoose.model("{Name}", {name}Schema)`
  - Specify the structure and conditions of the information to be stored in the DB.

# Main Challenge üî•

## Work in Collaboration

### Challenge
- Lack of collaborative development experience.
  - Expressing what we want about codes in words was difficult.
- Difficulty in communication between team members.
  - Lack of uniformity among team members' codes

### How to Overcome
- Divided our tasks
  - Maker flow, Solver flow, Database, and CSS(design).
- Set Development rules
  - In **commit messages**, **division of branch**, and **pull requests**
  - Try to understand others' codes and improve `communication quality`.
- Using collaboration tools
  - Figma, Miro, and Notion.
  - Fully understood what each member said by `visualizating screen` and `diagrams`.

## Libraries & Frameworks

### Challenge
- Lack of libraries and frameworks experience
  - Dealing with `dynamic routing` in Next.js.
  - Understanding concept of `SSR` and `SSG` in Next.js.
  - Understanding and utilizing `Grid` in Material-UI.

### How to Overcome
- Sharing contents that learned newly or applied to the code.
  - Share the reference links or videos.
  - Try to understand the `philosophy` and `patterns` of libraries and frameworks.

<!-- ## User Interfaces

### Challenge
- Hard to modify code neatly with desired UI.
  - Put the BAUHAUS styled patterns to the personal pages.Thus, some functions about choosing colors or orders of patterns are needed. 
  - There are some slightly different functions in each page, but overall look was similar.

### How to Overcome
- Designed to match the React by making our UI consistent and reusable. -->

# What We Learned üßë‚Äçüíª

## Work in Collaboration
1. We realized that efficient progress is possible after we define the overall frame and structures of client, server, and DB, then distribute tasks.
2. All the team members have other projects and exams, so sharing each progress with others was really important because each built functions in different places and time. It is critical not only to establish development rules and code review methods in advance, but also to make efforts to clearly communicate each work or situation with others.
3. All the members had a different picture of the project in their head, and the detailed functions and page flow were also different. Before distributing tasks, it is necessary to visualize them (flowchart or GUI) so that we can look in the same direction.
4. We often had disagreements. For the consensus, we tried to make the criteria based on the direction and characteristics of the website, not the individual's taste. Through this process, we can create a consistent web service.

## Libraries / Frameworks / Tools
1. Each framework contains its characteristics and the philosophy of the developer who made it. Also, to make good use of the built-in funtions in each frameworks or libraries to implement what we want.
2. To facilitate high scalability and maintenance, we find it necessary to consider various utilization possiblities and choose appropriate frameworks and code structures.
3. In detail, we realized each framework's features.
   1. React
      - Designed to `separate` and `synthesize` components to maximize the reusability.
      - Write code `concisely` using React hooks.
   2. Next.js
      - Easy to develop separate pages and components.|
      - Easy to implement `dynamic routing`.
      - Easy to implement with `SSR` and `SSG` for `SEO`.
      - Provides functions related to `router` and `image`.|
   3. Material UI
      - `Easily implement UI` without writing css one by one.
      - MUI's sx option allows to insert the specific css.
   4. Mongo DB
      - Can store many different forms of data.
      - MongoDB has a good `scalability` and `flexibility`.
   5. Vercel & Heroku
      - `Easy to deploy` of client and server

# Issue and Known Bug üêû
- We used dynamic routing by query. If users go back the pages or refresh the screen, the errors will occur
